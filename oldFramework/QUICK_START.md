# 🚀 Quick Start - Folder Organization

## ✅ Your Codebase is Already Well Organized!

Your current folder structure is **drag-and-drop ready** and **super simple to understand**. Here's what you have:

## 📁 Main Folders

### 1. **Configs/** - All Settings
**Location:** `ReplicatedStorage/Configs/`
- One place for all game settings
